# Small Projects

Welcome to the **Small Projects** repository! This is a collection of small yet useful projects and scripts that I have created to solve everyday problems or explore new ideas in programming. Each project is unique and showcases different skills and concepts, primarily using Python.

## Projects

Here is a list of some of the projects included in this repository:

- **[FileFlow_Organizer.py](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jit-mukherjee)**: A Python script that renames files in a directory based on their creation time. This helps organise files chronologically, making them easier to find and manage.
  - **Technologies Used**: Python, `os`, and `time` modules.
  - **Usage**: Suitable for cleaning up directories with scattered files by sorting them according to their creation dates.

*(Add more projects as you create them!)*

## How to Use

Each project will have its folder containing the source code and a `README.md` file explaining the project, its purpose, and how to use it. To use any of the projects, clone this repository and navigate to the desired project folder:

```bash
